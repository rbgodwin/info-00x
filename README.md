### What does it do?

- Explains the use of NMOS Control Frameworkin NMOS environments.
- Provides practical "how-to" example of how to set up an NMOS Controllable node 
- Provides a "how-to" use an NMOS Controler to interact with an NMOS Controllable node.

### Why does it matter?

- Many NMOS Users would like to control NMOS nodes using open specifications and within an overall NMOS environment.
- NMOS vendors would like to have the ability to extend control features in a way that highlights capabilities of their device while offereing a path towward interopberability and adoption of their specifications by the wider AMWA community.

### How does it work?

The NMOS Control Framework provides a new control endpoint discoverable by IS-04 along with specifications on a protoctol and model of controls using best practice current web based technologies such as webIDL, JSON, and websockets.
